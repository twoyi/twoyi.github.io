The ADB instructions in videoï¼š

> /system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests persistent; /system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 2147483647

If you no longer use the Twoyi and want to restore the impact of the above command, you can restore it by executing the following command:

> /system/bin/device_config set_sync_disabled_for_tests none; /system/bin/device_config put activity_manager max_phantom_processes 20

Attention:

1. If you have root privileges, you can execute the above command directly with root privileges; no ADB is required.
2. After executing this command, the corresponding auxiliary app (such as the Black Threshold in the video) can be uninstalled.

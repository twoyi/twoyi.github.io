It provides system-level functionality that typically requires device modifications, but works as a standard application on Android 8.1 through 12.</p><h2 id="why-twoyi" tabindex="-1">Why Twoyi? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-twoyi" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Traditional methods of customizing Android or using advanced features often require:</p><ul><li>Unlocking the bootloader (which voids warranty on many devices)</li><li>Rooting the device (which compromises security)</li><li>Installing custom ROMs (which can be complex and risky)</li></ul><p>Twoyi solves these problems by providing a containerized Android environment that:</p><ul><li>Runs as a normal app without special permissions</li><li>Maintains isolation from your main system</li><li>Boots in seconds</li><li>Allows customization without modifying your actual device</li></ul><h2 id="key-capabilities" tabindex="-1">Key Capabilities <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-capabilities" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Twoyi enables several use cases that would typically require device modifications:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Xposed Framework Support</strong>: Use Taichi\xB7Yang without unlocking the bootloader.
